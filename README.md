<h1>This is a base to write custom firmware for Creality 3D V1.1.4 Control Board</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>

This project enables you to upload custom firmware to the Creality 3D V1.1.4 control board using PlatformIO and an Arduino as an ISP (In-System Programmer). 
By leveraging firmware resources from TH3D Studio, we identified the necessary pin configurations and adapted the pins_arduino.h file for seamless integration.


<h2>Key Components</h2>

PlatformIO: Development and firmware upload environment.

Arduino as ISP: Used to program the Creality control board.

Firmware Sources: Parsed from TH3D Studio resources.

pins_arduino.h: Pin definitions for accurate hardware mapping.


<h2>Credits</h2>

This project builds upon firmware resources provided by TH3D Studio and utilizes PlatformIO's robust toolset for embedded development.

<h2>License</h2>
